So here i was just finding out the universities library was open for not students. So of course i went and got myself a memberships card. But there was one really annoying thing.

They had some books that you could only read if you where studying at the college and practically all the books i want to read are "UGent only". 
But i was tired of scrolling through almost endless amounts of pages so i made this a generic webscraping thingy...
